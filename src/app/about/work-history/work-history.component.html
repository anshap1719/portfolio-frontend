  <h2>I started my development career as a simple task to build a static website for a College Club.</h2>
  <h3>In 2015, I was a part of a REEF – an Environment Club at my college. I was tasked with building a simple informational website for the club. This was also my first time learning on Udemy and FreeCodeCamp and first time coding.</h3>

  <h2>After getting foundational skills, I was able to successfully freelance.</h2>
  <h3>I immediately fell in love with it as I know that this is the only kind of job I can work with which will allow me to attend college, work, and travel. I started out with websites like Fiverr and Freelancer.com but then, I came to know about Upwork and it became the sole platform for finding online work for me.</h3>

  <h2>​​My big break as a freelancer happened when I was offered to join the development team at Greater Commons by it's Founder Todd McLeod.</h2>
  <h3>I was taking Todd's Golang course on Udemy so I knew that Greater Commons was in development. One day, I messaged Todd on Twitter to read my blog (my first blog) if he could and let me know how I did. To my surprise he offered me to join the development team at Greater Commons as a Junior Developer.</h3>

  <h2>This was when I realized how challenging it would be to become exceptional.</h2>
  <h3>The GC experience taught me a lot and exposed me to how much I had to learn. I took it as a challenge, started learning as much as I could through working with the Greater Commons Team and through blogs, courses, anything else I could find, and did a fairly good job there.</h3>

  <h2>After a few months at Greater Commons, I finally got my first gig on Upwork.</h2>
  <h3>Since then, I've come a long way as a developer. ​​I take every job seriously and treat it as a learning opportunity. I have worked with a lot of clients on Upwork ranging from designers and developers to founders and project managers and have worked on a wide array of projects.</h3>
