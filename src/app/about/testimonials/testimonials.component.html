  <h2>Todd McLeod – CEO And Founder, Greater Commons</h2>
  <h3>“Anshul Sanghi receives my strongest recommendation. He is talented, hard-working, and has a great attitude. It has been my pleasure to know Anshul over the last two years. First Anshul was a student in my programming class. He did exceptionally well in this class. His performance was so exemplary that I asked Anshul to work with me on a project, building the Greater Commons platform. Anshul's contributions to this project were also exemplary. Notably, Anshul was working with a team that spoke English, which is a second language for him. Also, Anshul was working remotely. Despite these two hurdles, Anshul was able to still contribute well to the project. He regularly attended online meetings and communicated well with the team. One of Anshul's greatest qualities is his persistence. Despite various hurdles, Anshul stayed focus both on the project's goals and also on his personal goals. I commend Anshul for this as persistence is one of the most important characteristics for success.”</h3>
