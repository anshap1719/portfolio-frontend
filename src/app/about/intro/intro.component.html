  <h2>Hi, I'm a Student, a Freelancer, a Consultant and a Traveller from Nagpur, India.</h2>
  <h3>I am doing major in Electronics and Communications from an Engineering College here in Nagpur.</h3>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Before I got into development and coding, I was a full-time gamer.</h2>
  <h3>But that all changed when I was tasked to learn basic web development (Simple HTML/CSS) to build a website for a College Club I was in at the time.</h3>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>And I haven't looked back ever since.</h2>
  <h3>This is evident from the fact that I got a Macbook soon after, leaving my gaming life behind.</h3>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Now, I work part-time as a Freelance Full-Stack Developer.</h2>
  <h3>I have worked on a wide range of projects, which have developed my full-stack abilities. Upwork is a reliable platform which has become my primary source of work. I have also worked on jobs Iâ€™ve gotten through referrals.</h3>
